## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learnt to use margins to center elements.
I have also learnt to follow the mobile-first workflow.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
main {
    width: 80%;
    margin: 3em auto;
    padding: 1em 1em 2.5em 1em;
    background-color: var(--white);
    border-radius: 1.5em;
}
```

### Continued development

I will focus more on CSS Grid and Flexbox in the future.
